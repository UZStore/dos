# ⭐ Discord Customer Role

#### Getting the Customer Role  🎫

If you provided your Discord address during the purchase, the customer role will be automatically assigned to you. If it doesn't arrive or you forgot to provide it, you can obtain it from the <mark style="color:green;">**#tebex-claim**</mark> room by using _`/claim tebex-id`_.

#### Finding Your Tebex ID 🆔

Normally, your Tebex ID is sent to your email address. If you can't locate it, check the email you received from [Tebex Checkout](https://checkout.tebex.io/payment-history/).

#### Troubleshooting Bot Issues 🤖

If the `/claim` command doesn't assign the role:

* Open a ticket in the <mark style="color:green;">**#create-ticket**</mark> channel.
* Provide your Tebex ID and request the customer role by stating "I want a customer role."
* Your customer role will be assigned promptly.
